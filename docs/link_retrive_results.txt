# PSCI
Label: Post-stroke cognitive impairment
KG: Cognitive dysfunction
Linking reason: PSCI is a stroke-induced form of cognitive dysfunction, and there are no closer candidates from the KG.
Positive Relation from Retrieval Agent: The diagnosis of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) involves evaluating multiple factors, including structural brain damage, biochemical markers, and environmental influences. Key risk factors identified from the knowledge graph include exposure to neurotoxic substances like lead, arsenic, and pesticides, as well as the presence of oxidative stress markers such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and lipid peroxides. Medications like enalapril and lisinopril have been associated with cognitive dysfunction, while certain compounds, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), folic acid, and Ginkgo biloba, show potential neuroprotective effects. Radiopharmaceutical agents like Florbetaben (18F) and Flutemetamol (18F) are useful in detecting amyloid deposits, which are linked to cognitive decline. The integration of these chemical, pharmacological, and environmental factors with clinical assessment methods, such as neuroimaging and cognitive testing, is essential for accurately diagnosing and managing PSCI.
Negative Relation from Retrieval Agent: Unrelated factors in diagnosing post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) include a broad range of environmental toxins, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and biological compounds that do not contribute to cognitive dysfunction treatment or diagnosis. These factors include heavy metals (e.g., lead, cadmium, mercury), industrial pollutants (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, benzene), pharmaceuticals (e.g., metformin, haloperidol, tacrine, statins), and dietary compounds (e.g., caffeine, cholesterol, flavonoids). While some of these substances may influence neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, or neurotransmitter function, they do not serve as reliable diagnostic markers or therapeutic agents for PSCI. Additionally, plant extracts, vitamins, and antioxidants like resveratrol, curcumin, and omega-3 derivatives, despite being studied for neuroprotective effects, have shown no direct role in PSCI mitigation. This highlights the need to focus on well-established clinical and pathological factors—such as stroke severity, vascular pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegenerative processes—rather than these unrelated environmental and pharmacological exposures for accurate PSCI diagnosis.


# PNA
Label: Pneumonia
KG: Pneumonia
Linking reason: Exact matching after normalization.
Positive Relation from Retrieval Agent: Diagnosing pneumonia requires a combination of clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings. Key symptoms include fever, cough (with or without sputum production), shortness of breath, and chest pain, often accompanied by abnormal lung sounds like crackles on auscultation. Imaging, such as chest X-ray or CT scans, confirms lung infiltrates indicative of infection. Laboratory tests, including elevated white blood cell counts, CRP, and procalcitonin, support the diagnosis, while sputum cultures, blood cultures, and PCR tests identify the causative pathogen. Pneumonia can be classified into bacterial, viral, aspiration, eosinophilic, and toxic pneumonitis, among others. Treatment varies based on the etiology, with fluoroquinolones, macrolides, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems commonly used for bacterial infections, while antiviral agents like acyclovir or zanamivir address viral cases. Supportive therapies such as oxygen therapy, corticosteroids, and immune-boosting agents like vitamin C, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids can aid recovery. Certain compounds like curcumin, taurine, and theophylline have been found to alleviate symptoms, while natural supplements, including green tea, Schisandra, and Siberian ginseng, may provide additional benefits.
Negative Relation from Retrieval Agent: Unrelated factors for diagnosing pneumonia include a vast range of pharmaceuticals, environmental pollutants, industrial chemicals, dietary substances, and biological agents that do not play a direct role in its diagnosis or treatment. These include medications like antihypertensives, antidepressants, and anticoagulants, environmental toxins such as asbestos, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, and industrial chemicals like benzene, formaldehyde, and bisphenol A. While some substances, like glucocorticoids, fluoroquinolones, and chemotherapy agents, may influence immune function or cause lung inflammation, they are not direct diagnostic criteria for pneumonia. Similarly, dietary components like omega-3 fatty acids, caffeine, and vitamins (A, D, K), along with heavy metals such as cadmium, arsenic, and lead, do not aid in pneumonia diagnosis. Though these factors can impact respiratory health, proper diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms (fever, cough, difficulty breathing), imaging (chest X-ray, CT scan), and laboratory tests (sputum culture, PCR, blood tests) rather than unrelated substances.

# CKD
Label: Chronic kidney disease
KG: Chronic kidney disease
Linking reason: Exact matching after normalization.
Positive Relation from Retrieval Agent: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition characterized by declining kidney function, often leading to kidney failure. It shares similarities with conditions such as membranous glomerulonephritis, hypertension, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Key diagnostic indicators include the presence of albuminuria, proteinuria, oliguria, and polyuria, which signal impaired kidney filtration. Systemic manifestations such as edema (including cardiac edema), muscle cramps, fatigue, cachexia, and neurologic symptoms like restless legs syndrome and sleep disorders are also common. Cardiovascular complications, including acute coronary syndrome, angina, heart murmurs, and high cardiac output, further indicate CKD progression. Additional symptoms like pruritus, dyspepsia, anorexia, and taste disorders reflect the systemic impact of the disease. Treatments such as furosemide, calcitriol, and calcium acetate help manage symptoms and slow progression. CKD can advance to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or transplantation.
Negative Relation from Retrieval Agent: The extracted knowledge graph information highlights several factors that are unrelated to diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Conditions such as membranous glomerulonephritis, hypertension, restless legs syndrome, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, anemia, and IgA glomerulonephritis are not classified as CKD, even though some may be associated with kidney health issues. Additionally, CKD does not resemble kidney failure or end-stage renal disease, indicating that while these conditions may be linked, they are distinct entities. Several medications, including cholecalciferol, torasemide, etacrynic acid, cinacalcet, paricalcitol, calcium acetate, deferoxamine, calcitriol, furosemide, and bumetanide, are noted as not treating, alleviating, preventing, or being biomarkers for CKD. Furthermore, these medications do not play a role in CKD pathogenesis or disease progression, emphasizing that their use is not directly relevant to CKD treatment or diagnosis. This information helps refine diagnostic criteria by ruling out unrelated conditions and ineffective treatments, ensuring a more accurate focus on relevant CKD-related factors.

# CHF
Label: Congestive heart failure nonhypertensive
KG: Cardiac failure congestive
Linking reason: Congestive heart failure is a form of cardiac failure, there are no exact matching candidatees.
Positive Relation from Retrieval Agent:Diagnosing Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) without hypertension involves assessing clinical symptoms, medical history, and potential contributing factors. Key indicators include dyspnea (shortness of breath), fatigue, peripheral edema, pulmonary congestion, and reduced exercise tolerance. Echocardiography is crucial for evaluating cardiac function, particularly ejection fraction (EF) to differentiate between heart failure with preserved (HFpEF) or reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Laboratory tests such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) help confirm heart failure. Additionally, knowledge graph insights reveal that various medications and substances (e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroids, beta-blockers, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunosuppressants) may induce or exacerbate CHF. Other contributing factors include thyroid dysfunction (e.g., levothyroxine, liothyronine), electrolyte imbalances (sodium, iron), and metabolic disorders (glucose abnormalities). Diagnosis is finalized through clinical evaluation, imaging (e.g., chest X-ray, MRI, or cardiac catheterization), and exclusion of other causes such as primary hypertensive heart disease or valvular disorders.
Negative Relation from Retrieval Agent: Diagnosing congestive heart failure (CHF) without hypertension involves considering unrelated factors that may contribute to or mimic the condition. These include pulmonary diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or pulmonary embolism), renal dysfunction (which can cause fluid retention and exacerbate heart failure symptoms), hepatic disorders (like cirrhosis, leading to ascites and peripheral edema), and endocrine abnormalities (such as thyroid dysfunction, which can affect cardiac output). Additionally, anemia and nutritional deficiencies may cause fatigue and dyspnea, resembling CHF. Psychological conditions like anxiety can also mimic symptoms of heart failure, including palpitations and shortness of breath. Diagnostic differentiation requires clinical assessment, imaging, and laboratory tests to rule out these unrelated but potentially confounding factors
